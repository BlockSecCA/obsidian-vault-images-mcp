# Quick Start - Obsidian Images v2

## Build & Install (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
cd "C:\Users\Carlos\OneDrive - AltoAzul Consulting Inc\code\claude-image-mcp\extension_v2"
npm install
```

### Step 2: Package the Extension
```bash
npx @anthropic-ai/mcpb pack
```

You should see `extension_v2.mcpb` created in the directory.

### Step 3: Install in Claude Desktop
1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Drag `extension_v2.mcpb` into the window
3. Click "Install"

### Step 4: Configure Directories
1. Go to: Extensions â†’ obsidian-vault-images-mcp-v2 â†’ Settings
2. You should see a UI similar to the Filesystem extension
3. Click "Add directory"
4. Enter: `C:\Users\Carlos\Documents\Obsidian\blocksec\Media`
5. (Optional) Add more directories if you have multiple vaults

### Step 5: Test It!
Ask Claude:
```
"Show me the Wardley Map from my vault"
```

or

```
"Display the Cynefin framework diagram"
```

## What You Get

âœ… Multiple image directories (unlike v1's single directory)
âœ… Add/remove directories without reinstalling
âœ… Native Claude Desktop UI for configuration
âœ… All your images from multiple vaults accessible

## If Something Goes Wrong

### Check Logs
Extensions â†’ obsidian-vault-images-mcp-v2 â†’ "Open Logs Folder"

Look for:
- `[STARTUP]` messages showing initialization
- `[ROOTS]` messages showing directory configuration
- `[HANDLER]` messages showing image requests

### Common Issues

**"No directories configured"**
â†’ You haven't added any directories yet - go to extension settings

**"Image not found"**
â†’ Check filename spelling and that it's in one of your configured directories

**"Server disconnected"**
â†’ Check logs for error messages - likely a path or permission issue

## Next Steps

Once working, you can:
1. Add more vault Media directories
2. Keep v1 installed alongside v2 to compare
3. Use v2 as your primary image access method

Enjoy seamless image access from your Obsidian vaults! ðŸŽ‰
